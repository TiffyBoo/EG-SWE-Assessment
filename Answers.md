2a. Entering via the light blue boundary appears to be a common strategy as it was done 23 rounds out of 30.

2b. The average timer that Team2 on T side enters BombsiteB with at least 2 SMG or rifles was 44 seconds.

2c. Based on the heatmap generated with where CT were in Bombsite B. We can tell the coaching staff that CT tends to camp near the top right box in Bombsite B as well as around the 2 boxes on site. 

3. One solution could be to create a program where the coaching can upload game data and be presented with the answers from 2a and 2b. 2c would require a request to line up the data to the map for better visualization.
